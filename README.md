# Sarah Hollingsworth React Portfolio
This portfolio serves as a brief overview of my development experience, including major projects and skills. It also serves as an avenue to learn more about me or contact me directly. This was created as a React app to continue to build experience and familiarity with the React framework given it's commonality in modern websites.
